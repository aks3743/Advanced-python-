# A refresher on regex

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Regular Expressions

1. What are regular expressions?
        
    Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are powerful text-processing patterns used to search for, match, and manipulate strings of text. They provide a concise and flexible way to describe complex text patterns.

2. Why are regular expressions useful in Python?
        
    Regular expressions are essential for text processing tasks such as data validation, text extraction, and search operations. They are widely used in Python for tasks like parsing log files, validating user input, and web scraping.

3. Basic use cases for regular expressions
        
    Regular expressions can be used to:
        - Validate email addresses and phone numbers.
        - Extract data from unstructured text.
        - Find and replace text patterns in documents.
        - Search for specific words or phrases in text.

## Lesson 2: Character Classes and Literals


1. What are character classes and literals?
   
    Character literals are specific characters that you want to match exactly. For example, "a" will match the character "a" in a string.

    Character classes are enclosed in square brackets [] and allow you to specify a set of characters to match. For example, [aeiou] will match any vowel.

2. How to match specific characters using literals
        
    To match a specific character, simply use that character as a literal in your regex pattern. 
    
    For example, "cat" will match the string "cat" in the text.

3. Using square brackets for character classes
        
    Square brackets allow you to create a character class to match any character within them. 
    
    For example, [aeiou] will match any vowel in a string.

4. Examples and exercises for matching single characters
        
        Examples: "Hello, world!" can be matched with "H", "e", "o", ",", " ", and so on.

        Exercises: Match all lowercase letters, match all digits, match all punctuation marks.

## Lesson 3: Special Characters

1. Understanding special characters like ".", "*", "+", "?", "^", and "$"
        
        Special characters in regex have special meanings and are used to match more complex patterns.

        For example, "." matches any character except a newline, "*" matches zero or more of the preceding element, "+" matches one or more, and "?" matches zero or one.

2. How to use special characters to match **patterns**
   
        Special characters can be combined with character literals and character classes to match specific patterns.

        For example, "ca*t" will match "ct", "cat", "caat", and so on.

3. Examples and exercises for matching patterns with special characters
        
        Examples: Match any word with "w.rd" (e.g., "word," "ward," "w3rd").

        Exercises: Match URLs that start with "http://" or "https://".

Lesson 4: Quantifiers

1. Introducing quantifiers like "{n}", "{n,}", "{n,m}"

        Quantifiers allow you to specify how many times a character or group should be repeated.

        "{n}" matches exactly n occurrences, "{n,}" matches at least n occurrences, and "{n,m}" matches between n and m occurrences.

2. How to use quantifiers for repetitive patterns
        
        Quantifiers are helpful for matching repetitive patterns like dates, phone numbers, or repeated characters.

        For example, "\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}" matches a standard date format like "09-25-2023."

3. Examples and exercises for matching repeated patterns
        
        Examples: Match valid phone numbers with various formats, such as "(555) 555-5555" or "555-5555."

        Exercises: Match valid email addresses with different domains, such as "user@example.com" or "contact@mywebsite.co.uk."


## Lesson 5: Alternation and Groups

1. Using "|" for alternation
        
        The pipe symbol "|" is used for alternation, allowing you to match one pattern or another.

        For example, "cat|dog" will match either "cat" or "dog" in a text.

2. Creating and using capturing groups with parentheses
        
        Parentheses () are used to create capturing groups. They allow you to group parts of a pattern and apply quantifiers or alternation to the entire group.

        For example, "(ab)+" will match one or more repetitions of "ab" in a string.

    Examples and exercises for alternation and grouping
        
        Examples: Match words that start with "apple" or "banana" using "(apple|banana)".

        Exercises: Match phone numbers in either "(555) 555-5555" or "555-5555" formats.

Lesson 6: Character Classes and Shorthand

1. How to use predefined character classes like "\d", "\w", "\s"
        
        Predefined character classes provide shortcuts for commonly used character groups.

        "\d" matches any digit, "\w" matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscores), and "\s" matches any whitespace character.

2. Using shortcuts like "\D", "\W", "\S"
        
        The capital versions of predefined character classes negate the matching.

        "\D" matches any character that is not a digit, "\W" matches any character that is not a word character, and "\S" matches any character that is not whitespace.

    Examples and exercises for using character classes and shortcuts
        Examples: Match all the digits in a string using "\d+", match all non-alphanumeric characters using "\W".
        Exercises: Match lines containing only whitespace characters, match lines that don't contain any vowels.

Lesson 7: Anchors

    Understanding anchors like "^" (start of string) and "$" (end of string)
        Anchors allow you to specify where in the string a match should occur.
        "^" matches the start of a string, and "$" matches the end.

    How to use anchors for precise matching
        Anchors are crucial for ensuring that your pattern matches exactly where you intend.
        For example, "^abc" will match "abc" only if it appears at the beginning of a string.

    Examples and exercises involving anchors
        Examples: Match lines in a text that start with "Chapter" using "^Chapter".
        Exercises: Match lines in a text that end with a period ".", match lines that contain the word "Python" at the beginning of a line.

Lesson 8: More Advanced Concepts

    Lookaheads and lookbehinds
        Lookaheads (positive and negative) and lookbehinds (positive and negative) allow you to match patterns based on what precedes or follows the current position in the string.
        They are useful for more complex matching scenarios.

    Non-capturing groups
        Non-capturing groups, denoted as "(?:...)", allow you to group patterns without capturing the matched text. This can be helpful for improving performance or simplifying your regular expressions.

    Examples and exercises for advanced concepts
        Examples: Match email addresses that are not part of URLs, use lookaheads to match numbers followed by "USD."
        Exercises: Match phone numbers that are not part of email signatures, use non-capturing groups to match optional prefixes.
